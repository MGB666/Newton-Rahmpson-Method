# Newton-Rahmpson-Method
Newton’s method, also known as the Newton-Raphson method, is a powerful numerical method for finding the roots of a function. It is named after Sir Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, who independently developed the method in the 17th century.
The method involves an iterative process that uses the first derivative of a function to approximate the location of its roots. Starting with an initial guess, the method generates a sequence of increasingly accurate estimates for the root until a desired level of accuracy is achieved.
The Newton-Raphson method has many applications in various fields, including engineering, physics, and finance. It is particularly useful when analytical solutions to equations are not available, or when solving the equa- tion analytically is too complex or time-consuming.
In this project, we will explore the theory behind Newton’s method and some examples of how it can be used to solve equations in practice.
