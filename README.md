# Newton-Raphson-Method

Newton’s method, also known as the Newton-Raphson method, is a powerful numerical method for finding the roots of a function. It is named after Sir Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, who independently developed the method in the 17th century.
The method involves an iterative process that uses the first derivative of a function to approximate the location of its roots. Starting with an initial guess, the method generates a sequence of increasingly accurate estimates for the root until a desired level of accuracy is achieved.
The Newton-Raphson method has many applications in various fields, including engineering, physics, and finance. It is particularly useful when analytical solutions to equations are not available, or when solving the equation analytically is too complex or time consuming.
In this project, we will explore the theory behind Newton’s method and some examples of how it can be used to solve equations in practice.


This project implements the Newton-Raphson method for solving scalar and vector-valued functions using Python. The algorithm is implemented using the numpy library and tested in Jupyter notebooks.

### Usage 

To use the Newton-Rahmpson method, simply import newton_rahmpson_method as nrm function from the newton_rahmpson_method.py file
